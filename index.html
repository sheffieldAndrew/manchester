        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>
          The history of Manchester encompasses its change from a minor
          Lancastrian township into the pre-eminent industrial metropolis of the
          United Kingdom and the world. Manchester began expanding "at an
          astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century as part of a
          process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by a boom in textile
          manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The transformation took
          little more than a century.
          <br />
          Having evolved from a Roman castrum in Celtic Britain, in the
          Victorian era Manchester was a major locus of the Industrial
          Revolution, and was the site of one of the world's first passenger
          railway stations as well as many scientific achievements of great
          importance. Manchester also led the political and economic reform of
          19th century Britain as the vanguard of free trade. The mid-20th
          century saw a decline in Manchester's industrial importance, prompting
          a depression in social and economic conditions. Subsequent investment,
          gentrification and rebranding from the 1990s onwards changed its
          fortunes and reinvigorated Manchester as a post-industrial city with
          multiple sporting, broadcasting and educational institutions.
