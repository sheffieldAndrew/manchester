          <p id="history-text">
            The history of Manchester encompasses its change from a minor
            Lancastrian township into the pre-eminent industrial metropolis of
            the United Kingdom and the world. Manchester began expanding "at an
            astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century as part of a
            process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by a boom in textile
            manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The transformation
            took little more than a century.
            <br>
            <br>
            Having evolved from a Roman castrum in Celtic Britain, in the
            Victorian era Manchester was a major locus of the Industrial
            Revolution, and was the site of one of the world's first passenger
            railway stations as well as many scientific achievements of great
            importance. Manchester also led the political and economic reform of
            19th century Britain as the vanguard of free trade. The mid-20th
            century saw a decline in Manchester's industrial importance,
            prompting a depression in social and economic conditions. Subsequent
            investment, gentrification and rebranding from the 1990s onwards
            changed its fortunes and reinvigorated Manchester as a
            post-industrial city with multiple sporting, broadcasting and
            educational institutions.
